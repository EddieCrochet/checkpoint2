              Eddie Crochet believes not only that any one can learn to play music and play it well, but that music serves an untapped
              potential in the minds of many people. That potential can manifest itself in a myriad of positive ways in the
              life of the individual. Music is honestly a magical journey and everyone and anyone has the power to unlock
              it to bring these positive changes into their lives.

              Eddie has been playing guitar since 2006 when he was only 10 years old. Immediately after picking up the instrument he began
              writing songs and developing a mastery for the art. He has played in several bands, released 2 full studio
              albums, played countless shows, and continues to write music and improve his musician skills.
