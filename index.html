        Eddie Crochet has been playing guitar since 2006 when he was only
        10 years old. Immediately after picking up the instrument he began
        writing songs and developing a mastery for the art. He has played in
        several bands, released 2 full studio albums, played countless shows, and
         continues to write music and improve his musician
        skills.

        Eddie belives not only that any one can learn to play music and play it well,
         but that music serves an untapped potential in the mind of many people. That 
         potential can manifest itself in a myriad of positive ways in the life of the 
         individual. Music is honestly a magical journey and everyone and anyone has the 
         power to unlock it to bring these positive changes into their lives.
